Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository! This annual event challenges participants to solve fun, festive programming puzzles each day leading up to Christmas.

## Disclaimer
- The code in this repo is **extremely** messy and written under time pressure.
- Version control is quite chaotic since I was frantically coding most mornings at **6 AM** on about **4 hours of sleep**.
- Please explore at your own discretion!

## Acknowledgments
- Huge thanks to [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/) and the entire AoC team for creating and maintaining this wonderful event.
- Shout-out to the **Advent of Code** community on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) for sharing their creativity and insights.
- I also used **ChatGPT** as a coding companion for some of these problems—though my performance was still a bit lackluster, it was a blast!

## Motivation and Experience
- I aimed to complete **all 25 days**—waking up early at 6 AM to tackle puzzles before heading to my full-time job.
- Competing with coworkers was exhilarating—some brilliant minds took part, and I learned a ton about computer science under heavy time constraints.
- Despite the frantic nature, it was an eye-opening and educational ride, and I look forward to refining my skills!
